# My Beer Can Collection

This repository contains the raw pictures of my 90ies beer can collection.

In the future I'd like to

1) turn the images upright
2) extract the actual can out of the background
3) detect EAN bar codes and look up data online
4) OCR to read labels?
5) join the 8 different sides into a full texture
6) create some nice presentation layer on top

Pull requests for any of this welcome!
